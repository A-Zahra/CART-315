**Design hypothesis**

Through this prototype, I could get more familiar with the Unity environment. 
I could apply some of the skills that I have learned so far. Creating various materials, 3D objects, and prefabs, 
I tried to see what Unity can provide its users with through these tools. In this prototype, 
I answered the following question:
How to design a simple playable game with various levels of difficulty using my current knowledge?

**List of questions for playtesters**

- How did you find the game subject?
- How well could I employ my skills to construct the game environment?
- What was the game difficulty level?
- Do you think I could expand this prototype idea and go further?
- What other barriers or stuff did you expect to come across?
- What did you find annoying?
- Did you find anything creative in this prototype? If so, what was it?
- What part of this prototype could get done differently?
- How many times did you play the game to get to the village?

**Reflection on the playtests**

I could find the responses to my questions pretty useful. I realized that most of the players liked the game's environment layout and assets design. They mostly loved the mushrooms' shape or how the game encompassed different levels. Some of them found the maze structure challenging, though. They believed that the distance between the maze walls was too tight. Also, it was mentioned that making the maze ground flat would facilitate the player's movement.

On the other hand, I received a lot of great ideas for how to level up my game design, improve its quality, and add to its interactiveness. For example, placing assets like little bunnies or treasures in the jungle or the big trap for the players to look for and find. Or embedding enemies on the player's way makes it harder for him to reach the village. 

In general, reading all of the playtests made me confident that I could well employ my current knowledge of Unity to create an interactive game environment. However, I need to polish the game assets and add a few more interactive assets if I want to work on this game as my final project.
